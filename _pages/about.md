I am a Ph.D. Student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg and Instituto Superior Técnico at the University of Lisboa. 

My current research interests are **usable security**, **formal verification**, and password managers. De-Fi finance and its link to usable security is also a topic that interests me. 

I am currently part of the [PassCert Project](https://passcert-project.github.io/) that aims to build a proof-of-concept password manager that, through the use of formal verification, is guaranteed to satisfy properties on data storage and password generation. We aim to determine whether formal verification can increase users’ confidence in PMs and thus increase their adoption.

I also love volunteering, and I'm currently collaborating with the [Portuguese Red Cross](https://www.cruzvermelha.pt/estruturas-locais-lista/169-castelo-branco.html) teaching young Afghan refugees programming. I played the violin and was part of my university musical group -- [TMIST](https://tmist.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). My hobbies include hiking and reading unpublished books.

Feel free to contact me using my socials to discuss any of these topics.
